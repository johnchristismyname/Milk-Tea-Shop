            <h1>BLACK TEA</h1>
            <p>Black tea is one of the most common tea types that comes served with a splash of milk. This tea is traditional and comes from the camellia sinensis plant and is considered one of the five true teas. There are different blends and styles of black tea all around the world. There is Assam black tea from India, Darjeeling (considered to be the champagne of teas), Ceylon from Sri Lanka, and then, of course, the flavored versions such as Earl Grey with its citrus and bergamot oils from England.</p>

            <h1>GREEN TEA</h1>
            <p>While you may be surprised to hear that green tea is a good match for milk you only have to look at matcha tea itself. This superfood health bursting brew is commonly served with milk especially in the much-loved matcha latte. The umami sweetness, the creaminess, and the delicate grassy flavors make for a perfect match. Green tea is also a good tea base for the Taiwanese style bubble tea, served with tapioca pearls.</p>

            <h1>OOLONG TEA</h1>
            <p>Another tea made from the tea plant, this ancient tea also has a heady mix of antioxidants, nutrients, and other good stuff. Oolong tea can be full-bodied and bold or delicate and grassy. It is another tea that works wonders with milk.</p>

            <h1>MILKY BUBBLE TEA</h1>
            <p>A southeast Asian fave that has winged its way into global culture thanks to its fun look and deliciously creamy and chewy taste, who doesn’t love the pure pleasure of milky bubble tea. Bubble tea is made from a tea base and is commonly topped with the milk of your choice (you can go wild with many milk types – from almond to coconut, sweet condensed to taro milk). It also comes loaded with tapioca pearls which gives it that chewy texture. This is a fun tea and often has some kind of brown sugar syrup mixed with tapioca balls to sweeten it up.</p>
